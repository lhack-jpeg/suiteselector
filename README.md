# suiteSelector

# This project was a simple web app for users to enter the toilets set out measurements.

# It then returns a web page with the available toilets that could be used with the basic specs of the toilets.

# To scrape the data, I used python and scrapy to go over the reece website.

# the scrapers can be found here:

# https://github.com/lhack-jpeg/bottom_toilet

# https://github.com/lhack-jpeg/back_inlet

# The web app itself was build using javascript and express.

# This website takes the input of the form and display what toilets could suit the users current layout

# The version can be found here: https://suiteselector.herokuapp.com/
